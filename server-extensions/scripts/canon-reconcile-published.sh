# canon-reconcile-published.sh <repo-path> <branch> [<pinned-oid>] -- replace a
# canonical checkout's branch ref with the just-published origin tip when, and

#
# The gap this closes (WP-530 Ф38, peer-session 2026-09-11-07, Claude+Kimi+Codex):
# sessions commit straight into the canonical checkout, isolate-push.sh carries
# those commits to origin as cherry-picks (new SHAs), and nothing afterwards
# moves the canonical ref -- so the canon is never an ancestor of origin again.
# canon-refresh.sh (clean + purely behind) and canon-reconcile.sh (dirty +
# purely behind) both refuse a diverged history by design; without this step the
# divergence grows until a human merges by hand (74/230 on 11.09).
#
# Contract (fail closed -- any doubt means "touch nothing, say why"):
#   preflight  no live session is writing into this host's checkouts (semaphores
#              under $IWE_RUNTIME_DIR/sessions without isolated_worktree and with a
#              live pid -- Codex, round 3: a re-check right before reset shrinks
#              the race with a concurrent writer but cannot close it, and this
#              script takes no snapshot of tracked dirt; until a barrier every
#              writer honours exists (Ф5.1) the only safe answer is skip + retry
#              on the next publish; re-checked right before the swap) · branch
#              as expected · index clean · tracked-tree dirt only where the
#              on-disk entry already equals the target's (mode+blob) or the
#              path is deleted here and absent there (WP-561 Ф24: point-
#              installed published bytes must not freeze the canon forever) ·
#              every local-only commit patch-equivalent to the target (`git
#              cherry` has no `+`) OR content-superseded (every path it touched
#              has the same tree entry in HEAD and target; no local merge
#              commits either way) · every
#              path `git reset --hard` would CREATE (added in target vs current
#              HEAD) is either absent on disk or identical in type, mode and
#              content -- checked on disk, so ignored files, case-folded names
#              and file-vs-directory clashes count too (cold review 11.09).
#   action     `git update-ref` with compare-and-swap on the old head, then
#              `git reset --hard` so index and tracked tree follow the ref.
#   postcheck  HEAD == pinned · tracked tree clean · the set of untracked paths
#              (mode, hash, path) is unchanged apart from paths the target now
#              tracks -- a changed hash, a missing path or a NEW path means
#              someone wrote during the window: reported, never called success.
# This script never writes inside the repository except through git itself:
# its own log goes to $IWE_RUNTIME_DIR/canon-reconcile-published.log (a ledger
# event inside the canon would dirty the very tree it is reconciling -- cold
# review 11.09 found the resulting 15-minute publish loop).
#
# Loudness (WP-530 Ф76): a refusal is silent by design, so a canon that cannot be reconciled used to look exactly like a
# healthy one. Every refusal prints how many times in a row this same class (the text before the first ':') has
# refused, over how many minutes, and how many tracked paths are dirty; when the class has lasted
# CANON_RECONCILE_ALERT_AFTER_SEC (default 3600) and at least CANON_RECONCILE_ALERT_MIN_COUNT times (default 3), one
# `ALERT` line is printed for the caller to forward, repeated no more often than CANON_RECONCILE_ALERT_REPEAT_SEC
# (default 14400). Any healthy exit clears the streak. The streak state lives next to the log, outside the repository.
# State handling (Codex review, peer-session 2026-10-01-20): the streak is an append-only JOURNAL (one O_APPEND write per
# refusal and per alert claim), so there is no read-change-write cycle to race, no lock to take or reclaim and no file to
# replace: parallel runs cannot lose a count, and the first alert claim of a window in file order is the only one that
# prints the ALERT. Every number is derived inside awk and reaches the shell as 1-12 digits (a damaged record is skipped, a
# damaged journal is a fresh streak, never an arithmetic error); an alert is printed only after its claim is on disk and
# only if the series is still valid when the claim is read back (within 120 s of writing it: a run that stalled longer
# prints nothing, since a later run may already have used the next window), and a journal that cannot be appended to (or a runtime
# directory that is not private to this user, or a path that is a symlink, a directory, a FIFO or somebody else's file)
# gives a warning and no alert at all -- an alert that cannot be rate-limited would repeat on every run. The journal is
# never cut, rotated or capped (any of those is a read-change-write again, or freezes a new series behind an old one): it
# grows by about 100 bytes per refusal until the first healthy exit removes it (through the same trusted chain as every
# other change of it; otherwise it stays and a warning says why).
# The contract of the repeat interval (accepted wording, peer-session 2026-10-01-20): with a continuous series and clocks that
# do not run backwards, the interval holds between the TIMES OF THE CONFIRMED ALERT CLAIMS. It is not promised between the
# ALERT lines or the deliveries: a run suspended for a long time between its last check and the print prints late (a duplicate
# line, never a lost one), and no shell script can close that without a serialized section. A claim that is never followed by a
# print can silence the alert until the end of the interval.
# Trust assumptions, stated once: processes of the same user are trusted; the runtime directory, the journal and every
# directory above them are not writable by anybody else (no write for group or others unless the sticky bit protects the
# entry), and are owned by this user or by root. If that cannot be shown, the streak is switched off LOUDLY. Times from the future are clamped (refusals) or ignored (claims stamped more than ten minutes
# ahead), so a clock set back mutes nothing for longer than the repeat interval.
#
# Exit: 0 = replaced, or nothing to do (already ancestor -> canon-refresh's job)
#       1 = refused (canon untouched) or post-check failed (ref already replaced
#           -- the message says which; both are logged)
#       2 = usage / repo error
